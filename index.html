            <p>I strongly believe our ever-evolving world will be defined by lines of code which is why I've spent over 5 years helping developers and people in tech easily build great careers from anywhere.</p>

            <p>When I was 17, I organized <a href="https://codetivate.devtranet.tech" rel="nofollow">Codetivate</a>, one of the world’s largest hackathons. Hosting over 1,700 up-and-coming developers from more than 70 countries after raising over half a million dollars in monetary and in-kind support from thirty companies, Intel's first maker researcher, two Forbes 30 under 30, and a Thiel Fellow whose maker community is backed by the founder of GitHub, Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin, and more.</p>
            
            <p>In less than a year, I grew <a href="https://genztechies.com" rel="nofollow">GenZtechies</a> into Africa’s largest network for Gen-Zs in tech shortly after founding The Dynamics to empower underprivileged makers and hackers around the world, since then it has reached over half a million hackers.</p>
            
            <p>My recent work is the Gen Z HackFest 2022 which hosted 2,500+ developers and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenZHackfest2022?src=hashtag_click" rel="nofollow">reached over a million</a> individuals from Africa and beyond with support from developer-centric brands like Filecoin & Vercel.</p>
            
            <p>Now, I'm co-founding <a href=”https://devtranet.tech” rel=”nofollow”>Devtranet</a> with Jakub Markowski, who has worked as a Senior Engineer at Google and Roblox for over 5 years; building software for millions of users. Our grand vision is to become the one-stop for developers and people in tech to build great careers from anywhere.</p>
